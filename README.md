=============
Diarrhea is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in young children from developing countries, leading to as many as 15% of all deaths in children under 5 years of age. While many causes of this disease are already known, conventional diagnostic approaches fail to detect a pathogen in up to 60% of diarrheal cases. Gut samples were collected from ~1000 samples from Bangladesh, Kenya, Mali and The Gambia. 


The following is a visualization of microbiome data of young children from low-income countries.
